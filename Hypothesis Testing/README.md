Here, I conduct hypothesis tests to determine if there exists a signifiacatn difference in 2 groups:
1. Light theme
2. Dark Theme
```
Alpha = Tgreshold to reject Null Hypothesis
P-value = Probablity of getting the observation if Null Hypothesis were to be correct

P-value > Alpha = Fail to reject Null hypothesis
P-value < Alpha = Reject Null Hypothesis

Low alpha = Harder to reject Null Hypothesis. 
High alpha = Easier to reject Null Hypothesis. 
```

Findings:

1. P-value of 0.63 is alot greater than generally accepted alpha of 0.05.
So, we fail to reject null hypothesis.
