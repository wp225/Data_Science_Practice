# Data Science Case Studies Repository

This repository contains practice case study projects focusing primarily on data cleaning and analytics.

Each project includes a README file containing the following information:

- **Dataset Used**
- **Problem Statement**
- **Analysis Methods**
- **Focus Areas**
- **Results**
- **Screenshots**

The forecasted EV registrations predict an even more dramatic increase in the near future, with the number of registrations expected to rise sharply in the coming years.

### Hypothesis Testing
```
Alpha = Tgreshold to reject Null Hypothesis
P-value = Probablity of getting the observation if Null Hypothesis were to be correct

P-value > Alpha = Fail to reject Null hypothesis
P-value < Alpha = Reject Null Hypothesis

Low alpha = Harder to reject Null Hypothesis. 
High alpha = Easier to reject Null Hypothesis. 
```

#### Hm P-value of 0.63 is alot greater than generally accepted alpha of 0.05.
##### So, we fail to reject null hypothesis.
