Data Analysis Case Study - HealthCare Data

Dataset includes health metrics from 500 individuals, featuring variables such as 
age, gender, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, body temperature,
and oxygen saturation, recorded over a specific period. These variables provide
a comprehensive snapshot of each patientâ€™s health status, which is crucial for
monitoring and managing various health conditions.

**Problem Statement :**
    Traditional health monitoring systems often categorize patient health status
    using rigid, predefined thresholds that may not capture the nuanced variations 
    across a diverse patient population. This can lead to oversimplified assessments and
    potentially overlook subtle yet critical patterns in health data. The challenge is to
    develop a more dynamic and responsive approach that utilizes unsupervised learning to
    identify natural groupings within health data, facilitating personalized and precis
    e health management.


**Expected Outcomes**:

Identified Clusters: Distinct patient groups based on health metrics, each with unique
characteristics that provide insight into their specific health needs.

Personalized Health Insights: Enhanced understanding of patient health requirements
and risks, enabling tailored intervention strategies.

Improved Health Monitoring: Recommendations for targeted monitoring and intervention 
strategies that cater to the specific needs of each cluster, leading to more effective health 
management and better patient outcomes.
